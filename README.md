# Unicorn_Companies
The purpose of this project is to talk about Unicorn Companies. I first had to learn to what a Unicorn company was; I learned that it was some of the companies that we have grown to love.  Unicorn Companies also have been around for years as well. This project will graph 5 Unicorn companies and their ages. 


SETUP: 
In order to run this project you will need the following modules installed on your computer, Pandas, Matplotlib, datetime. I would also download the csv file so you can have the information for the project so the code will run smoothly. The data from the csv file for this project can be found at kaggle.com, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/unicorn-companies-dataset  My code was also wrote in Visual code studio in jupyter notebook.  

The five features I chose for my project are the following: 

1. Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json or any other file type. 

2. Use custom functions or lambdas to perform specific operations or manipulate your data, return those values, then use them in other parts of your project. 

3.Do 5 basic calculations with Pandas, like finding the sum(), median(), mean(), mode(), of a column.

4.Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting. 

5.Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, explain what the reader is seeinf and why you chose to plot things that way.
