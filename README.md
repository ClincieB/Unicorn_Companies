# Unicorn_Companies
The purpose of this project is to talk about Unicorn Companies. I first had to learn to what a Unicorn company was; I learned that it was some of the companies that we have grown to love.  Unicorn Companies also have been around for years as well. This project will graph 5 Unicorn companies and their ages. I also learned there is at least over 1000 Unicorn Companies and according to investopedia anything defined as a Unicorn Company is an business refers to a startup company with a value of over $1 billion dollars. The project inparticularly will be talking about the ages of the Unicorn Companies. 

The five features I chose for my project are the following: 

1. Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json or any other file type. 

2. Use custom functions or lambdas to perform specific operations or manipulate your data, return those values, then use them in other parts of your project. 

3.Do 5 basic calculations with Pandas, like finding the sum(), median(), mean(), mode(), of a column.

4.Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting. 

5.Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way.
